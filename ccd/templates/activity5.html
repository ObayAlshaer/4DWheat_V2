  Activity 5.1: Genomics and Valuation of International Wheat Germplasm Flow
</span>

<p><b>Objectives:
</b></p>

<ul>
<li>To develop a Canadian component to the international annotated wheat variety database;
</li>

<li>To publish a spatially aggregated farm-level economic model that can more accurately quantify the value of Canadian wheat genetic gain in Canada;
</li>

<li>To develop internal reports estimating the economic value of potential cultivars for pre-breeding activities
</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Objectives:
</b></p>

<ul>
<li>To describe and analyze plant-based regulatory structures in Canadian trade relevant countries;

</li>

<li>To conduct an economic analysis of the impact of a reform of Canadian PNT regulatory reform on research and breeding investment.
